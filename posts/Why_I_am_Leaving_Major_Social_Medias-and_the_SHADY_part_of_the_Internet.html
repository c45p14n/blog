                <p>
                I’m done playing in someone else’s living room. After years of using major social platforms and
                relying on <b>closed-source</b> , <b>corporate-controlled</b> hardware and software, I’ve chosen to remove my 
                presence from mainstream social media and actively reduce my footprint on the open internet. 
                This isn’t panic — it’s a deliberate decision based on several recurring realities that have made 
                online life feel <b>unsafe</b>, <b>opaque</b>, and fundamentally <b>out of my control</b>.
                </p>
                <h2>Proven risks of proprietary, un-auditable systems</h2>
                <p>
                Many of the services and devices we rely on are built on <b>proprietary code and sealed firmware</b> that 
                <b>users can’t inspect or control</b>. That means <code>critical parts of my digital life run inside black boxes</code>:
                Closed-source social platforms centralize huge amounts of personal data and choose how it’s stored,
                <b>analyzed, and shared</b> — often without clear, user-friendly control.
                Device firmware (from Wi‑Fi chips to system controllers) and proprietary OS components can include 
                telemetry, undocumented features, or security holes that users and independent researchers can’t 
                fully audit.
                When a subsystem is closed and privileged, the only parties that can realistically find and fix deep 
                problems are the vendor and a small set of researchers — <b>not the people who depend on the devices.</b>
                That lack of auditability removes both control and trust. If I can’t verify what runs on the hardware 
                that holds my data or mediates my communications, I don’t want to rely on it.
                </p>
                <h2>The Intel Management Engine and similar “always-on” subsystems</h2>
                <p>
                One concrete example that crystallized my decision is the family of privileged subsystems built 
                into modern hardware — the Intel Management Engine (ME), Converged Security and Management Engine 
                (CSME), and vendor equivalents. Key concerns:
                These are essentially separate microcontrollers running firmware with deep access to memory, 
                peripherals, networking, and sometimes the ability to operate while the main OS is powered down.
                The code is proprietary and cryptographically locked to vendor-signed images, so users cannot 
                replace or fully audit it.
                Over the years researchers and incident responders have found serious vulnerabilities in ME/CSME 
                and in related out‑of‑band management technologies (AMT, BMCs, etc.). Some vulnerabilities allow 
                remote attackers or local attackers with physical access to gain highly privileged execution.
                Real-world actors — from advanced criminal groups to state-linked operators — have shown interest 
                in firmware and management-engine-level compromises because they’re stealthy and persist across 
                reinstalls.
                </p>
                <p>
                in simple words: owning the firmware layer means having a backdoor-level capability. Whether those 
                subsystems were designed with hostile intent or for legitimate manageability, their presence and 
                documented vulnerabilities make me uneasy about placing trust and personal data on platforms that 
                depend on them.
                </p>
                <h2>Evidence of targeted surveillance and exploitation</h2>
                <p>
                <li>Large-scale leaks, disclosed vulnerabilities, and reported exploits show two things:
                Intelligence agencies and criminal groups both pursue access to core hardware and firmware. 
                Public reporting and forensic work have repeatedly shown attackers aiming below the OS to maintain 
                stealth.</li>
                <li>When privileged, proprietary subsystems are compromised, the attack surface expands dramatically — 
                attackers can persist, tamper with logs, or exfiltrate data even if the main OS is reinstalled.
                Those incidents aren’t hypothetical. They shifted my threat model from “someone scraping my profile”
                to “powerful actors can observe or control my device in ways regular users can’t detect or fix.”</li>
                </p>
                <h2>social platforms themselves amplify risk</h2>
                <p>
                Even without exotic firmware attacks, mainstream social media <b>centralizes metadata, content, and 
                social graphs</b>. Effects include:
                </p>
                <p>
                Highly detailed targeting capability for advertisers, political actors, and bad actors.
                Large-scale data collection, retention, and sharing that can be subpoenaed, leaked, or abused.
                Automated systems and opaque moderation/algorithmic decisions that shape visibility and can expose 
                private information unpredictably.
                </p>
                <p>
                For me, the combined risk of centralized data collection plus the invisible hardware/firmware layer is unacceptable.
                </p>
                <h2>Practical harms I want to avoid</h2>
                <p>
                Permanent digital traces of sensitive conversations, relationships, and opinions.
                Identity profiling that feeds advertising, surveillance, or coercive actions.
                The possibility of undetectable compromise via firmware or management subsystems.
                Being forced to rely on corporations or vendors to remediate deep technical failures.
                </p>
                <h2>What I’m doing instead</h2>
                <p>
                I removed myself from major social networks and began the following, focused on minimizing 
                dependency on closed systems:
                </p>
                <p>
                <li>Deleted or deactivated accounts on major platforms; requested data removal where possible.</li>
                <li>Migrated essential communication to tools where I control the endpoint (end‑to‑end encrypted 
                messengers on devices I manage) and limited metadata exposure. (eg. Matrix)</li>
                <li>Replaced or minimized use of hardware with known un-auditable subsystems where feasible 
                (using devices and vendors with stronger transparency, or older hardware without those features).</li>
                <li>Hardened remaining devices: firmware/BIOS updates from trusted vendors, disabled out‑of‑band 
                features when possible, and minimized unnecessary network services. (with LibreBoot you can disable IME)</li>
                <li>Adopted a “need-to-know” sharing posture: fewer public profiles, less personal data published, 
                and using throwaway contact points for nonessential services.</li>
                <li>Shifted attention to small, federated, or self-hosted communities when I want connection (or to 
                private, well-defined groups I trust).</li>
                </p>
                <h2>What I’m not claiming</h2>
                <p>
                Absolute safety. Removing myself from popular social media and aggressively reducing reliance on 
                opaque hardware reduces my exposure and control loss, but no setup is perfect.
                That every firmware concern is actively exploited against ordinary people today. 
                Many vulnerabilities are exploited primarily in high-value operations. Still, the combination of 
                centralized social data and privileged firmware makes the risk unacceptable to me personally.
                </p>
                <h2>Why this matters for others</h2>
                <p>
                If you value control over your digital life, consider the same trade-offs I did: the convenience of 
                large platforms and modern hardware versus the risk of invisible, hard-to-audit systems and centralized 
                data collection. Even small actions—reducing platform use, using privacy-respecting services, keeping 
                devices up to date, and turning off unnecessary management features—raise the bar for attackers and reduce 
                reliance on closed systems.
                </p>
                <h2>Closing</h2>
                <p>
                I chose to delete myself from major social media and step back from large parts of the public 
                internet because I don’t want my life mediated by corporations I can’t audit and hardware that 
                can be turned into an invisible spying vector. It’s a practical, precautionary move: I’m trading 
                some convenience for more control, fewer permanent traces, and less exposure to opaque, high‑privilege 
                layers that have repeatedly proven risky.
                </p>
