                <p>
                This started as a university project — a simple assignment to make a <b>"networked sensor"</b> — 
                and somehow turned into a tiny clandestine camera that fits in the palm of my hand.
                I used the <em>esp32-cam-webserver</em> (an expanded version of Espressif's CameraWebServer) 
                as the base for everything: wiring, web UI and streaming. The example I used is the 
                <a href="https://github.com/easytarget/esp32-cam-webserver/tree/master" class="styled-link">easytarget/esp32-cam-webserver</a> project.
                </p>
                <p>
                If you're new: the ESP32-CAM modules combine a microcontroller, a camera sensor (<b>OV2640</b> in many case) 
                and a few pins exposed for programming and control.  (I used a Dev-Board beacuase I couldn't trust my friends to not fry the board)
                </p>
                <p>
                For my build I used:
                </p>
                <ul>
                <li>ESP32-CAM module (with OV2640)</li>
                <li>Dev-Board with MicroUSB port (for uploading the sketch)</li>
                <li>Well-powered supply that can supply a steady 5V (or 3.3V through <b>a regulator</b>) — the camera is picky about power</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Flashing the firmware (The Easy way)</h2>
                <p>
                I used the Arduino IDE to compile and flash the sketch from the repo. The sketch exposes 
                a small web server — you power the board, the serial prints an IP, and visiting that IP in 
                a browser gives you a live <code>MJPEG</code> stream and control pages.
                The repo already has the web UI and helpers; you can tweak resolution, flip the image, and enable 
                OTA updates for more advanced workflows.
                </p>
                <h2>Board & IDE settings</h2>
                <ol>
                <li>Install the ESP32 board support in Arduino IDE (search "esp32 by Espressif Systems" in Boards Manager).</li>
                <li>In <strong>Tools &gt; Board</strong> choose <em>AI Thinker ESP32-CAM</em> (or the board matching your module).</li>
                <li>Select the correct COM port, hit Upload. If upload hangs, ensure GPIO0 is grounded and press RESET when the uploader output shows the initial boot message.</li>
                </ol>
                <h2>Configure the sketch</h2>
                <p>
                Open <code>myconfig.sample.h</code> in the repo, copy it to <code>myconfig.h</code>, then set:
                </p>
                <ul>
                <li>Enable <code>AP Mode</code> or your Hotspot won't be enabled for you to connect</li>
                <li><code>WIFI_SSID</code> and <code>WIFI_PASSWORD</code></li>
                <li>Camera model if asked (OV2640 is common for AI-Thinker)</li>
                <li>Any stream or webserver options you want</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                Then recompile and upload. Once the sketch boots, the serial monitor (115200 baud) will often print the IP address assigned by your router — type that in a browser on the same network to view the web UI or stream.
                </p>
                <h2>From class demo to multi-use gadget</h2>
                <p>
                What began as a graded assignment quickly became a tool for experiments. I used it to:
                </p>
                <ol>
                <li>Monitor my room (time-lapse snapshots)</li>
                <li>Quickly prototype visual detection ideas on a laptop via HTTP snapshots</li>
                <li>Learn about supply-stability: short power cables and a stable 5V made the difference between smooth streaming and constant reconnects</li>
                </ol>
                <h2>Making it a spy gadget (the fun, low-effort tweaks)</h2>
                <p>
                Once the camera is stable on your network, you can add small touches :
                </p>
                <ul>
                <li>Hide the module inside a small project box and poke just the lens through a tiny hole.</li>
                <li>Use the web UI to set low resolution for longer battery life and more discreet streaming.</li>
                <li>Mount it like a dummy alarm sensor or tuck it behind a fake book — remember to obey laws and ethics: never record people where they expect privacy.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Advanced ideas (when you're ready)</h2>
                <p>
                If you want to go beyond the basic sketch:
                </p>
                <ul>
                <li>plug out the Dev-Board and mount a chargable battery in the back of your board to work without being plugged to a PC & be able to hide it in better spots.</li>
                <li>Look for actively maintained ESP32 webcam projects (newer cores and libraries) if you need modern compatibility.</li>
                <li>Add microSD logging (some modules support it) for local snapshots.</li>
                <li>Integrate with Home Assistant or a small MQTT bridge for event-based imaging.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Final notes</h2>
                <p>
                This project turned a classroom exercise into a versatile little device. If you follow the repo's instructions for wiring, programming, and the provided web server, you can have a camera on your network in an evening.
                Tinker and learn.
