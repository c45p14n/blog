    <h2>In Which Humans Climb Mountains, Start Podcasts, and Generally Panic About Meaning</h2>    

    <p>
    Once upon a time, in the grand cosmic joke we call existence, humans discovered something terrifying: 
    they could think about thinking. Unlike the blessed pigeons pecking at bread crumbs or cats knocking 
    things off tables with pure, purposeless joy, humans looked up at the stars and asked, "But <b>why</b> though?"
    </p>
    
    <p>
    And thus began humanity's most epic quest more dramatic than Odysseus sailing home, more obsessive than 
    Ahab chasing his whale. The search for <strong>Purpose</strong> with a capital P, that golden fleece of 
    meaning that apparently everyone needs or they'll simply combust into existential despair.
    </p>
    
    <h2>The Ancient Prophecy</h2>

    <p>The old myths understood something we keep forgetting: humans are <b>really bad</b> at just existing.</p>

    <p>
    Sisyphus had his boulder. Prometheus had his liver-eating eagle situation. Even the gods themselves were 
    running around having affairs and starting wars because apparently eternal bliss gets boring without a hobby. 
    The ancients knew that humans need a quest, a reason, a <b>thing</b> otherwise they'd just sit around 
    realizing how weird it is that we're conscious meat puppets on a rock floating through infinite space.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    So we built temples. Wrote epic poems. Invented cults, philosophies, and self-help books. All different 
    ways of answering the same question : "What am I supposed to be doing with this absurd gift of awareness?"
    </p>
    
    <h2>The Modern Hero's Journey (AKA: The Hustle)</h2>
    <p>Fast forward to today, and nothing has changed except now we have Instagram to document our existential crises.</p>
    
    <p>
    Watch the modern human in their natural habitat: They'll wake up at 5 AM to run marathons, adopt minimalism, 
    start dropshipping businesses, learn Portuguese, ferment their own kombucha, and launch a podcast about their 
    "journey"—all before lunch. Why? Because the alternative is sitting quietly with their thoughts, and that 
    way lies <b>madness</b>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Purpose has become the dragon everyone must slay, except the dragon is invisible and might not exist and also 
    you need to post about slaying it on LinkedIn or it doesn't count.
    </p>
    
    <h2>The Lengths We'll Go (Spoiler: It's Ridiculous)</h2>
    
    <p>Here's the truly mythical part: humans will do <b>literally anything</b> to feel purposeful. And I mean anything.</p>
    
    <p>
    They'll spend years getting degrees they don't care about. Work jobs that slowly devour their souls like Kronos 
    eating his children. Move to different continents. Join movements. Start movements. Quit movements when those 
    movements don't give them enough meaning. They'll have children (creating new humans who will also need purpose talk 
    about a pyramid scheme). They'll climb actual mountains just to stand on top and think, "Yes, this pile of rocks gives 
    my life meaning."
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Some will dedicate themselves to helping others. Some to accumulating wealth. Some to art, science, or arguing with 
    strangers on the internet. The what doesn't really matter it's the <b>having</b> a purpose that counts.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    It's like we're all on individual hero's journeys, except there's no mentor, the map is missing, and we're not entirely 
    sure what we're supposed to be heroic about. But by the gods, we'll figure it out or die trying. (Preferably die while 
    looking purposeful.)
    </p>
    
    <h2>The Cosmic Joke</h2>
    
    <p>Here's what makes this whole situation mythically absurd : purpose is both completely made up <b>and</b> absolutely essential.</p>
    
    <p>
    Unlike a phoenix that knows its job is to burn and be reborn, or a dragon that simply vibes in its cave guarding gold, 
    humans have to <b>invent</b> their own reasons for existing. We're the only creature cursed with enough intelligence to need meaning 
    but not enough wisdom to know what that meaning should be.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    So we make it up. We tell ourselves stories. We become heroes of our own epic tales even if those tales are about selling insurance 
    or collecting vintage stamps or making the perfect sourdough starter. We turn our random acts into quests, our mistakes into character 
    development, our suffering into "growth opportunities."
    </p>
    
    <p>
    And somehow, this complete fabrication becomes real. The purpose we invent starts to actually work. People will genuinely find meaning 
    in the strangest things. They'll spend decades perfecting a craft nobody asked for. Fight for causes that history might forget. Love 
    people who'll die anyway. Build things that'll crumble.
    </p>
    
    <h2>The Great Paradox</h2>
    
    <p>The most ridiculous part? We <b>need</b> this fiction.</p>
    
    <p>
    Strip away someone's purpose and watch them unravel faster than Theseus's thread. Humans without purpose don't just feel sad they feel 
    <b>erased</b>, like side characters in someone else's story. We'd rather have a terrible purpose than no purpose at all. At least 
    Sisyphus had his boulder. At least Prometheus knew why that eagle kept showing up.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    This is why people join cults, start wars, devote themselves to ridiculous causes, or become <b>extremely</b> serious about their fantasy 
    football leagues. The human brain looks at the void of meaninglessness and says, <b>"Absolutely not." I'm making up a reason to exist, and I'm 
    making it everyone's problem.</b>
    </p>
    
    <h2>The Moral of Our Myth</h2>
    
    <p>
    So here we are, billions of humans on a spinning rock, each desperately trying to matter. Some find their purpose in grand ambitions. Others 
    in small, quiet moments. Most of us stumble through life hoping we're the protagonist and not just background noise in the universe's elevator 
    music.
    </p>
    
    <p>And maybe that's okay.</p>
    
    <p>
    Maybe the search itself is the point. Maybe we're all just Sisyphus, rolling our boulders up different mountains, and the secret is that the boulder 
    <b>is</b> the purpose. Maybe purpose isn't something you find it's something you drag behind you, getting heavier and more absurd with each passing 
    year, until one day you look back and realize it's shaped your entire existence.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Or maybe, just maybe, we're all taking this way too seriously, and the pigeons pecking at breadcrumbs have it figured out better than we ever will.
    </p>
    
    <p>Either way, we're stuck with this need for meaning. Might as well make it a good story.</p>
